The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, it might result in unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if you forget to put spaces around the `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/` operators, the calculation will be incorrect, and the CSS might not work as expected. Another potential issue is using incompatible units within the calculation, e.g. mixing pixels and percentages directly in the same calculation without proper conversion.
